# TSW-auctions
Importing a university project. JavaScript auction-house app, similar to allegro.pl or ebay

Two important files not included: key.pem and cert.pem (security reasons). If you switch from https to http (little changes required in index.js file) it'll run without them.

Running:
1. npm run install
2. npm run build (optional beucase built files are included)
3. npm run server

Server starts at port 25565, but feel free to change that for a test run.
